## IPL-Match-Prediction-Based-on-Powerplay-using-Machine-Learning
## To Predict Match winner based on Powerplay Score. 
#### 1. Right from the start of IPL from 2008 to 2022, a Total of 946 Games have been played in 15 seasons. 
#### 2. I have considered only 8 consistent teams to predict a match winner based on Powerplay. As, the rest of the teams have only little data points. In Future, I can tweak the model so that the performance will be good.
#### 3. I have tried using Random Forest, XGBOOST Classifier, XGBoost Classifer with Random Forest applying GridSearchCV technique.
#### 4. Out of all these models, XGBoost with Random Forest Classifier worked well with accuracy of 72%.
#### 5. We can improve the performance of this model if we have few more data as I considered only consistent teams who had wins more than 50.
#### 6. Right now, I just build the model. I am in the process to deploy the model. Hope it works well. :) :D
#### THANK YOU.
